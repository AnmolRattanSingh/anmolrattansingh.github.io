      <title>Building a Pan-Tilt 3D Scanner</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My team built a servo-driven pan-tilt mount for an infrared proximity sensor. To demonstrate the functionality of our design, we created a 3D scan of a cardboard letter cut in a Z shape. This project involved (1) designing and 3D-printing a pan-tilt servo and IR sensor, (2) programming an arduino to collect scan data, (3) projecting data from spherical coordinates into Cartesian coordinates in order to isolate a cross-section scan of the letter. I was responsible for the CAD mechanical design and making the 3D data projection and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Handwriting Detection With Faster R-CNN &#43; Experiments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://indico.io/&#34;&gt;Indico Data Solutions&lt;/a&gt; provides services to extract information from scanned pdfs. Since their existing OCR + NLP pipeline did not extract handwriting, one of my internship projects involved creating a robust solution to detect and classify handwriting using a deep learning computer vision model. I started by fine-tuning upon the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497&#34;&gt;Faster R-CNN model&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2&#34;&gt;Detectron-v2 framework&lt;/a&gt;. Then I tried to improve upon the baseline performance with (i) different pre-training tasks, (ii) multi-label formulation, (iii) strategies to improve small object detection, and (iv) different label sets and datasets. This report documents my methods and finishes with a class confusion analysis and retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Survey of Data Structures for Large Scale Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/survey-of-data-structures-for-large-scale-information-retrieval/</link>

      <guid>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/survey-of-data-structures-for-large-scale-information-retrieval/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A survey of data structures used in large-scale information systems. Covers (i) how the inverted index data structure allows for constant time querying (ii) the need, problems, and clever design details of methods to compress big numbers (focusing on Elias-Fano and Partitioned Elias-Fano), and (iii) BitFunnel, an unusual probabilistic data structure used by the Bing search engine to bypass the curse of inverted index global updates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Implementing Fast and Space-Efficient Look-up and Search</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bloom filter data structure tracks set-membership in a fast and space-efficient way. I first heard about Bloom filters when a start-up I was working for used Bloom filters to speed up their database search. Then, I heard about Microsoft using a stack of Bloom filters (a bit-sliced document signature data structure) to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3077136.3080789&#34;&gt;speed up the Bing search engine&amp;rsquo;s keyword search&lt;/a&gt;. In this project, I explored these interesting data structures by implementing a Bloom filter and a bit-sliced document signature in C. I also wrote unit tests and a collection of fun demos to show how Bloom filters and bit-sliced signatures can be used. This report gives an overview of the project, demos and results, and highlights notable code design decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All code is available in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GatiAher/BloomForSearchFromScratch&#34;&gt;GitHub Repo&lt;/a&gt;. I documented my progress on this &lt;a href=&#34;https://trello.com/b/xzVRxTDJ/bloomforsearchfromscratch&#34;&gt;Trello Board&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Facial Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/facial-recognition-using-principal-component-analysis/</link>

      <guid>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/facial-recognition-using-principal-component-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used multiple variations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in my research on microbial community analysis. To explain the core theory and assumptions of PCA to my lab group, I fleshed out an analysis of a toy example (eigenfaces) that I had originally seen in class. This analysis reasons about the assumptions of PCA and the effects of applying it to out-of-distribution data by using PCA to perform facial recognition on a dataset of my classmates&amp;rsquo; faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: My research professor recommended my presentation to her connection at Łódź University, Poland, who in turn invited me to be a virtual presenter at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ms-my.facebook.com/MathUpConference/photos/because-the-mathup-conference-is-conducted-in-both-polish-and-english-another-du/2805409529774282&#34;&gt;Łódź University&amp;rsquo;s SP2021 MathUp conference&lt;/a&gt;. The conference was an incredibly fun opportunity to meet fellow researchers and data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Fourier Transform Detective Story!</title>
      <link>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/a-fourier-transform-detective-story/</link>

      <guid>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/a-fourier-transform-detective-story/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of research students had tried to use a 2D discrete Fourier Transform to characterize the pattern of repeating protein units on a bacteria surface layer image. Since their spectral graph looked unusually messy and their pattern estimates seemed very wrong, my research professor asked me to take a crack at interpreting and cleaning it. My successful analysis helped the research group complete their paper and publish their findings. This project was a pretty neat application of understanding the mathematical assumptions of a technique to properly isolate and interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
