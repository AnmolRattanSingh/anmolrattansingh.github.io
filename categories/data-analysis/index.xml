      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://indico.io/&#34;&gt;Indico Data Solutions&lt;/a&gt; provides services to extract information from scanned pdfs. Since their existing OCR + NLP pipeline did not extract handwriting, one of my internship projects involved creating a robust solution to detect and classify handwriting using a deep learning computer vision model. I started by fine-tuning upon the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497&#34;&gt;Faster R-CNN model&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2&#34;&gt;Detectron-v2 framework&lt;/a&gt;. Then I tried to improve upon the baseline performance with (i) different pre-training tasks, (ii) multi-label formulation, (iii) strategies to improve small object detection, and (iv) different label sets and datasets. This report documents my methods and finishes with a class confusion analysis and retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Facial Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used multiple variations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in my research on microbial community analysis. To explain the core theory and assumptions of PCA to my lab group, I fleshed out an analysis of a toy example (eigenfaces) that I had originally seen in class. This analysis reasons about the assumptions of PCA and the effects of applying it to out-of-distribution data by using PCA to perform facial recognition on a dataset of my classmates&amp;rsquo; faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fun fact: My research professor recommended my presentation to her connection at Łódź University, Poland, who in turn invited me to be a virtual presenter at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ms-my.facebook.com/MathUpConference/photos/because-the-mathup-conference-is-conducted-in-both-polish-and-english-another-du/2805409529774282&#34;&gt;Łódź University&amp;rsquo;s SP2021 MathUp conference&lt;/a&gt;. The conference was an incredibly fun opportunity to meet fellow researchers and data scientists.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Fourier Transform Detective Story!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of research students had tried to use a 2D discrete Fourier Transform to characterize the pattern of repeating protein units on a bacteria surface layer image. Since their spectral graph looked unusually messy and their pattern estimates seemed very wrong, my research professor asked me to take a crack at interpreting and cleaning it. My successful analysis helped the research group complete their paper and publish their findings. This project was a pretty neat application of understanding the mathematical assumptions of a technique to properly isolate and interpret the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
