      <title>Handwriting Detection With Faster R-CNN &#43; Experiments</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://indico.io/&#34;&gt;Indico Data Solutions&lt;/a&gt; provides services to extract information from scanned pdfs. Since their existing OCR + NLP pipeline did not extract handwriting, one of my internship projects involved creating a robust solution to detect and classify handwriting using a deep learning computer vision model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started by fine-tuning upon the &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497&#34;&gt;Faster R-CNN model&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2&#34;&gt;Detectron-v2 framework&lt;/a&gt;. Then I tried to improve upon the baseline performance with (i) different pre-training tasks, (ii) multi-label formulation, (iii) strategies to improve small object detection, and (iv) different label sets and datasets. This report documents my methods and finishes with a class confusion analysis and retrospective.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>EMG Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/emg-gesture-recognition.md/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project followed the topological data analysis steps laid out in &lt;a href=&#34;http://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2017.0734&#34;&gt;Phinyomark et al (2017) &amp;ldquo;Navigating features: a topologically informed chart of electromyographic features space&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; to analyze 43 features extracted from surface EMG signals of three gestures (rock, paper, scissors) performed by a single subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used sklearn&amp;rsquo;s topological data analysis tools with the Kepler Mapper and Ward&amp;rsquo;s minimum variance method as the criterion for hierarchial clustering in order to analyze feature redundancy. Comparison of feature class separability was analyzed by calculating Davies-Bouldin index (DBI) and Fisher&amp;rsquo;s linear discriminant index (FLDI), and measuring misclassification rates. 5-fold cross validation Linear Discriminant Analysis and Support Vector Machine were employed as classifiers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Facial Recognition Using Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>http://GatiAher.github.io/projects/facial-recognition-using-principal-component-analysis/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have used multiple variations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in my research on microbial community analysis. To explain the core theory and assumptions of PCA to my lab group, I fleshed out an analysis of a toy example (eigenfaces) that I had originally seen in class. This analysis reasons about the assumptions of PCA and the effects of applying it to out-of-distribution data by using PCA to perform facial recognition on a dataset of my classmates&amp;rsquo; faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was invited to present this project at &lt;a href=&#34;https://ms-my.facebook.com/MathUpConference/photos/because-the-mathup-conference-is-conducted-in-both-polish-and-english-another-du/2805409529774282&#34;&gt;Łódź University&amp;rsquo;s SP2021 [virtual] MathUp conference&lt;/a&gt; at Łódź University, Poland. The conference was an incredibly fun opportunity to meet fellow researchers and data scientists!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Fourier Transform Detective Story!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A group of research students had tried to use a 2D discrete Fourier Transform to characterize the pattern of repeating protein units on a bacteria surface layer image. Since their spectral graph looked unusually messy and their pattern estimates seemed very wrong, my research professor asked me to take a crack at interpreting and cleaning it. This was a neat application of understanding the mathematical assumptions of a technique to properly isolate and interpret results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
